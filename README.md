# JBake-Blender-4.4

## About the project

Hi, I made some fixes to the JBake Tools addon originally created by Jayanam, all credits to its original creator. I modified the addon to make it functional in Blender 4.4, because when I tried to use it I got the error ‘OBJECT_OT_bake_op to call callback function “execute”’.


I hope you like it and I hope it will be useful for your projects.
